Challenge
=========
# OpenMP Code Challenge
We believe that OpenMP is ready for your code, therefore the OpenMP ARB issued
this challenge at SC14:-

> Bring us shared memory or offload code (C++ AMP, CUDA, OpenACC&reg;,
> OpenCL&reg;, ...) from your **real applications**. We'll show you how to
> write it in modern OpenMP.

# What code do we want?  
We're interested in real application code, not just code snippets. We
believe that with the release of OpenMP TR3, OpenMP is the best
directive based language to use to exploit all of your expensive
hardware.

Therefore, the codes we'd like 

* Are real codes that are important to you
* Are open source (since we're asking you to push them here, that should be
obvious)
* Have build and correctness testing scripts
* Have some documentation so that we can understand at least how to
build and test them. Ideally a little more too!

If you are only interested in seeing how we can express specific,
small operations, we'll look at those too, but we'd prefer to show you
that our specification can handle the complexities of real
applications, not just toy kernels.

# How do I submit code?  

Clone this repository, create a new branch, add your code in a new
sub-directory, push back to github in your clone, and then send us a
pull request via the ["Code Challlenge"list](http://openmp.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=15) at the OpenMP
Forum. We'll pull your code here and start to look at it.

Please include a `licence.txt` (or equivalent file), so that we can be
confident that we are allowed to look at your code in an un-encumbered
manner. (Without this we won't pull the code).
